== Nirtzah, Conclusion

=== _Kos Hartza-ah_, the Fourth Cup--the Cup of Acceptance

Leader:: As our Seder draws to an end, we take up our cups of wine. The
Redemption is not yet complete. The fourth cup recalls us to our promise to one
another, to the tasks that still await us as a people called to service of
justice and freedom, and the preservation and affirmation of hope.

Group:: _Baruh Atah Adonai Eloheinu Meleh ha-olam borei p'ri ha-gafen._ +
We give thanks for the bounty of the earth, which creates the fruit
of the vine.

_(All drink the fourth cup of wine.)_

Leader:: The Seder service now concludes: +
Its rites observed in full,
Its purposes revealed.

Group:: This privilege we share will ever be renewed.
Until humanity's destiny is known in full,
its highest purposes met.

Leader:: Peace!

Group:: Peace for us! For everyone!

Leader:: For all people, this, our hope:

Group:: Next year, may all be free!

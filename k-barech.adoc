=== _Kos Eliyahu_, the Cup of Elijah

****
Elijah, the prophet from the village of Tishbi in Gilead, challenged the
injustice of the king and overthrew the worship of Baal. He healed the humble
sick and helped the widowed. 

The prophet Malachi promised that Elijah would come to turn the hearts of
parents to children, and the hearts of children to parents, and to announce the
day when all humanity would celebrate freedom.

Hence, he has a place in every Seder. We open the door that he may enter, and
set a cup of wine to represent his place.
****

Leader:: The injustice of the world brings to mind Elijah who in defense of
justice, challenged power. In many tales from Jewish lore, he reappears to help
the weak. Let us now open the door for Elijah!

_(A child opens a door to the outside.)_

Child:: Who is Elijah? I don't see him.

Leader:: But Elijah's cup is empty! _(Show empty cup.)_ Who drank Elijah's wine?

Group:: _All_ who work for justice are deserving of Elijah's wine.

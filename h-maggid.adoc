== Maggid, The Narration

One:: There are many questions. Now we begin to answer.

[verse]
Our history moves from oppression towards freedom.
Our narration begins with degradation and rises to dignity.
Our service opens with the rule of evil and advances towards
    the fulfillment of humanity.

Group:: _We_ were oppressed, and _we_ through perseverance freed ourselves. Had
we not done so, then we, our children, and our children's children would still
be oppressed.

One:: Therefore, even if all of us were wise, all of us people of
understanding, all of us learned in every way, it would still be our obligation
to tell this story of freedom. Moreover, whoever searches deeply into its
meaning is considered praiseworthy.

Group:: For the story is not yet complete.

One:: We have known physical bondage and spiritual servitude. +
We have also been subjected to _social degradation._ 
For in the eyes of others we were a subject people.

Group:: My ancestors were fugitives, and in an unwelcoming land became a great
and powerful nation.

_(Go around the table - where did everyone's ancestors come from?)_

One:: In an unwelcoming land the people attained great power, but were
unloved for it. And the leaders of the land said "`Look, they have become too
numerous for us. Let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they increase, and in
the event of war, join our enemies in fighting against us.`"
+
So they set taskmasters over them, embittering their lives with forced labor at
mortar and brick and work in the fields. But the more they were oppressed, the
more they increased and spread out, so that the leaders of the land came to
dread them even the more so.

_(All raise their cups of wine.)_

One:: Through tenacity and courage, justice prevailed.

Group:: For more than one enemy has risen against us to destroy us. In every
generation, in every age, some rise up to plot another's annihilation. But as
of yet, the goodness of humanity has won out over evil.

_(All replace their cups untasted.)_

One:: What does it mean to _win_ over evil? Though people do evil
deeds, every person's life is still precious and deserving of redemption. 

Group:: Though we have ourselves rejoiced to see oppressors overcome, +
yet our triumph is diminished +
by the slaughter of the foe, +
as the wine within the cup of joy is lessened +
when we pour ten drops for the plagues upon humanity.

One:: Our rabbis taught:

"The sword comes into the world because of justice delayed and justice denied."
-- Pirkei Avot 5:8

Group:: To remember upheaval that follows oppression, we pour ten drops for
the plagues upon humanity. Each drop of wine we pour is hope that people will
cast out the plagues that threaten everyone everywhere they are found,
beginning in our own hearts.

	the teaching of hate and violence,
	despoliation of the earth,
	perversion of justice and government,
	fomenting of vice and crime,
	neglect of human needs,
	oppression of nations and peoples,
	corruption of culture,
	subjugation of science, learning, and human discourse,
	the erosion of freedoms.

=== The Four Answers

One:: The wise tell us that whoever does not consider well the _meaning_ of
what they do in a ritual has not fulfilled the purpose of that ritual.
+
Like much of the Passover Seder, the Four Questions are both central and
disputed; many Jews forget that it is only hundreds, not thousands of years
old, and that Seders -- like any ritual -- have changed in the telling over
time. These questions originally were the opposite of what they are here.
Today, we recite the questions and answers by rote; originally, they were
given as examples of questions that children should be, through education,
expected to ask _on their own_, without prompting. The rabbis who first
described these questions would be horrified, but over hundreds of years,
their thoughtfulness and wisdom ossified and became ritual.
+
Nevertheless, we ask:

_(Participants take turns reading.)_

_Why do we eat matzah?_

History teaches us that when the opportunity for freedom arises, it must
sometimes be taken quickly, without planning or preparation. Matzah is baked,
but unrisen dough; without even time to let dough rise, matzah is the simple
food eaten by the newly free and fleeing. That is why we eat matzah on Pesach.

_Why do we eat bitter herbs?_

The bitterness of maror symbolizes lives made bitter by slavery and oppression.
That is why we eat moror (or horseradish) on Pesach.

_Why do we dip herbs twice?_

We dip the parsley because it reminds us of the green that comes to life again
in the springtime, and the salt water reminds us of the tears of people before
they become free. We dip the moror, the bitter herbs, in the sweet charoyses
as a sign of hope for freedom.

_Why do we dine with ceremony?_

Slaves are forced to eat quickly because their masters do not permit them to
waste a single moment when they could be working. And so, slaves eat either
standing up or squatting on the ground. At our Passover Seder, we mark our
freedom by eating at length, with special ceremony.

One:: The tradition is to say "`Each of us should feel as though they
themself had gone forth from bondage.`"  This reminds us not to treat history
as foreign or made-up. It happened to real people, and by imagining it
happening to us, we understand it better.

Group:: "`It was _we_ who were slaves, _we_ who were strangers.`" 

One:: You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the feelings of the
stranger,

Group:: having yourselves been strangers in an unwelcoming place.

One:: When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not wrong
him. You shall love him as yourself,

Group:: for you were strangers in an unwelcoming place.

One:: You shall work to protect the rights of the stranger.

Group:: Always remember that _you_ were a slave.

One:: And while we are all free people here, we also say 

Group:: "`No one is free while others are oppressed.`" 


_(The wine cups are raised.)_

One::

[verse]
Therefore, let us rejoice
At the wonder of our deliverance
    From bondage to freedom,
    From agony to joy,
    From mourning to festivity,
    From darkness to light,
    From servitude to redemption.
Let us ever sing a new song.

=== _Kos G'ulah_, The Second Cup--The Cup of Redemption

One:: With the second cup of wine we look with hope to the promise of
liberation for all people.

Group:: _We_ will work towards freedom for all.
+
Remembering with gratitude the redemption of our ancestors, +
rejoicing in the fruits of our struggle for freedom, +
we look now with hope to the celebration of a future redemption.
+
_Baruh Atah Adonai Eloheinu Meleh ha-olam borei p'ri ha-gafen._ +
We give thanks for the bounty of the earth, which creates the fruit
of the vine.

_(All drink the second cup of wine.)_

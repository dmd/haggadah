== Korech, Continuity With Past Tradition

One:: Preserving a bond with the observance of our ancestors, we follow a
practice of Hillel, who combined the matzah and maror and ate them together.

Group:: Together they shall be: the matzah of freedom, the maror of oppression. +
For in the time of freedom, there is knowledge of persecution. +
And in the time of tyranny, the hope of redemption.

_(Eat maror and haroset between two pieces of matzah.)_

=== Four Questions

Child::  Why is this night different from all other nights?
+
On all other nights we eat bread or matzah. 
Why on this night do we eat only matzah?
+
On all other nights we eat any kind of vegetables.
Why on this night do we eat bitter ones?
+
On all other nights we do not dip herbs at all.
Why on this night do we do so twice?
+
On all other nights we eat in an ordinary manner. 
Why on this night do we dine with special ceremony?

=== Four Children

One:: Throughout history good teachers have understood that different kinds of people learn better in different ways.

One:: The *wise* person asks, "`What led to the Passover seder as it
is observed today?`" To that person we should explain the Passover tradition
thoroughly, so that it and its meaning is completely understood.

Group:: It is the wise who want to understand what it is they undertake.

One:: The *simple* person asks, "`What is this?`" To that person we
say, "`Once we were oppressed, and we made ourselves free.`"

Group:: To the person of open simplicity, give a straightforward,
comprehensible answer; for simply learning to repeat without understanding is
not wisdom.

One:: The *wicked* person says, "`What is this observance to _you_?`"
By saying "`to _you_`" and not "`to _us_,`" the wicked person rejects the unity
of family and the commonality of humanity. Yet we must respond _not_ with more
wickedness and alienation, but with inclusion and love.

Group:: The wicked one withdraws from anything beyond their own self; thus more
than anyone else, they are in need of the help of others.

One:: With the person *unable to ask*, you must begin telling the
story yourself, saying: "`This is because of what my ancestors did for _me_
when _I_ freed myself from oppression.`"

Group:: With one who has no need to know, no will to serve, you must begin
yourself to awaken the need, to give the will.

One:: As in the pages of our histories, so too in the events of our time, in
the encounters of our daily lives, these persons the wise, the simple, the
wicked, the unable to ask, reappear in various guises. Their questions must be
pondered and answers sought, the story given life and meaning.

.The Fifth Child
****
Optional:: We also remember a fifth child. This is a child of the
Holocaust, who did not survive to ask. Therefore, we ask for that child --
Why? We are like the simple child. We have no answer. We answer that childâ€™s
question with silence. In silence, we remember that dark time. In silence, we
remember that Jews preserved their culture in the struggle for life. In
silence, we remember the seder nights spent in the forests, ghettos, and
camps; we remember that seder night when the Warsaw Ghetto rose in revolt.

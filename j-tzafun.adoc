== Tzafun, The Search for the Hidden

****
Toward the end of the meal, the children look for the Afikoman, which the
leader has hidden. Since neither the meal nor the Seder can be concluded before
some of the group has eaten a piece of it, whoever finds the Afikoman may
demand a reward. Nothing is (traditionally) eaten after the Afikoman, so that
the matzah may be the last food tasted.

The afikoman replaces the "`after-dinner entertainment`" (epikomios), an aspect
of the ancient Roman feast that the rabbis eliminated from the Seder so that
the entire evening might be devoted only to the observance of Passover. Yet
song and festivity remain a part of the Seder feast.

.Who Knows One?
_to be recited in descending triangular order, e.g. 1, 21, 321, 4321 ..._
[verse]
Who knows thirteen? I know thirteen!
Thirteen are the attributes of God
Twelve are the tribes of Israel
Eleven were the stars in Joseph's dream
Ten commandments were given on Sinai.
Nine are the number of the holidays
Eight are the days to the service of the covenant
Seven days there are in a week
Six sections the Mishnah has
Five books there are in the Torah
Four are the number of the matriarchs
Three are the number of the patriarchs
Two are the tables of the commandments
One is our God!
In Heaven and on Earth

Who can name the things mentioned in each line? Remember what we discussed earlier. If we just recite things without understanding, we have not accomplished anything tonight.

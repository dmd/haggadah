== Karpas, Rebirth and Renewal

One:: Pesach is a springtime holiday. The _karpas_ (parsley) reminds us of
springtime and hope. We dip the karpas in salt water because tears taste salty.
We remember the tears of the oppressed.  And may we never be so comfortable
that we become complacent and forget the pain of others. May we always be able
to feel the connection between our own struggle for freedom and todayâ€™s
struggles against oppression, no matter where they occur.

Group:: While anyone is oppressed, so am I.

One::

[verse, Song of Songs 2:10-12 &amp; 7:13]
____
Arise my beloved, my fair one,
And come away;
For lo, the winter is past.
Flowers appear on the earth,
The time of singing is here.
The song of the dove
Is heard in our land.

Let us go down to the vineyards
To see if the vines have budded.
There will I give you my love.
